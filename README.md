In this project the idea is to make learning Math easier for primary or/and secondary school students. This program includes calculators and explanations, by the help of which students can practise applying formulas and calculations on their own.

I would like to say special thanks to @Sentdex, whose tutorial videos helped me a lot with using tkinter.
